# eCommerce--using-AWS
This is a serverless e-commerce website using AWS Free Tier. The frontend is on S3 with CloudFront, and the backend uses API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB. The admin panel manages products, while customers can add items to the cart and place orders. Future updates will include payments and authentication.
